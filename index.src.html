  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Although [[RFC1918]] has specified a distinction between "private" and
  "public" internet addresses for over a decade, user agents haven't made
  much progress at segregating the one from the other. Websites on the public
  internet can make requests to internal devices and servers, which enable a
  number of malicious behaviors, including attacks on users' routers like those
  documented in [[DRIVE-BY-PHARMING]] (and, more recenly, [[SOHO-PHARMING]] and
  [[CSRF-EXPLOIT-KIT]]).

  Here, we propose a mitigation against these kinds of attacks that would
  require internal devices to explicitly opt-in to requests from the public
  internet.

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The overarching goal is to prevent the user agent from inadvertantly enabling
  attacks on devices running on a user's local intranet, or services running on
  the user's machine directly. For example, we wish to mitigate attacks on:

  *   Users' routers, as outlined in [[SOHO-PHARMING]]. Note that status quo
      CORS protections don't protect against the kinds of attacks discussed here
      as they rely only on [=CORS-safelisted methods=] and
      [=CORS-safelisted request-headers=]. No preflight is triggered, and the
      attacker doesn't actually care about reading the response, as the request
      itself is the CSRF attack.

  *   Software running a web interface on a user's loopback address. For better
      or worse, this is becoming a common deployment mechanism for all manner of
      applications, and often assumes protections that simply don't exist (see
      [[AVASTIUM]] and [[TREND-MICRO]] for recent examples).

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-deny-by-default">Secure by Default</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc's routers have a fairly serious CSRF vulnerability which allows
    their DNS settings to be altered by navigating to
    `http://admin:admin@router.local/set_dns` and passing in various GET
    parameters. Oh noes!

    Happily, MegaCorp Inc's routers don't have any interest in requests from the
    public internet, and didn't take any special effort to enable them. This
    greatly mitigates the scope of the vulnerability, as malicious requests will
    generate a <a>CORS-preflight request</a>, which the router ignores. Let's
    take a closer look:

    Given `https://csrf.attack/` that contains the following HTML:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe href="https://admin:admin@router.local/set_dns?server1=123.123.123.123"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    `router.local` will be resolved to the router's address via the magic of
    multicast DNS [[RFC6762]], and the user agent will note it as
    [=IP address space/private=]. Since `csrf.attack` resolved to a
    [=public address=], the request will trigger a [=CORS-preflight request=]:


    <pre>
      OPTIONS /set_dns?... HTTP/1.1
      Host: router.local
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Request-Method</a>: GET
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Request-Private-Network</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://csrf.attack
    </pre>

    The router will receive this `OPTIONS` request, and has a number of possible
    safe responses:

    *   If it doesn't understand `OPTIONS` at all, it can return a `50X` error.
        This will cause the preflight to fail, and the actual `GET` will never
        be issued.

    *   If it does understand `OPTIONS`, it can neglect to include an
        <a http-header>`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`</a> header in its
        response. This will cause the preflight to fail, and the actual `GET`
        will never be issued.

    *   It can crash. Crashing is fairly safe, if inelegant.
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-opt-in">Opting-In</h4>

  <div class="example">
    Some of MegaCorp Inc's devices actually need to talk to the public internet
    for various reasons. They can explicitly opt-in to receiving requests from
    the internet by sending proper CORS headers in response to a
    <a>CORS-preflight request</a>.

    When a website on the public internet makes a request to the device, the
    user agent determines that the requestor is [=IP address space/public=], and
    the router is [=IP address space/private=]. This means that requests will
    trigger a [=CORS-preflight request=], just as above.

    The device can explicitly grant access by sending the right headers in its
    response to the preflight request. For the above request, that might look
    like:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://public.example.com
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</a>: GET
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</a>: true
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network</a>: true
      Vary: Origin
      Content-Length: 0
      ...
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="shortlinks">Navigation</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. runs an internal link shortening service at `https://go/`, and
    its employees often email such links to each other. The email server is
    hosted at a <a>public address</a> in order to ensure that employees can work
    even when they're not at the office. How considerate!

    Clicking `http://go/*` links from `https://mail.mega.corp/` will trigger a
    <a>CORS-preflight request</a>, as it is a request from a <a>public
    address</a> to a <a>private address</a>:

    <pre>
      OPTIONS /short-links-are-short-after-shortening HTTP/1.1
      Host: go
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Request-Method</a>: GET
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Request-Private-Network</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://mail.mega.corp
    </pre>

    In order to ensure that employees can continue to navigate such links as
    expected, MegaCorp chooses to allow private network requests:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://mail.mega.corp
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</a>: GET
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</a>: true
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network</a>: true
      Vary: Origin
      Content-Length: 0
      ...
    </pre>

    MegaCorp's leak-prevention department is worried, though, that this access
    will allow external folks to read the location of any redirect that the
    shortener would return. They're more or less resigned to the fact that
    `https://go/shortlink` will leak, but would be sad indeed if the target
    (`https://sekrits/super-sekrit-project-with-super-sekrit-partner`) leaked
    as well.

    MegaCorp's shortlink engineers are careful to avoid this potential failure
    by returning CORS headers <em>only</em> for the preflight. The "real"
    navigation doesn't require CORS headers, and they don't actually want to
    support cross-origin requests as being CORS-same-origin:

    <pre>
      // Request:
      GET /short-links-are-short-after-shortening HTTP/1.1
      Host: go
      <a http-header>Access-Control-Request-Private-Network</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://mail.mega.corp

      // Response:
      HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
      ...
      Location: https://sekrits/super-sekrit-project-with-super-sekrit-partner
    </pre>

    The navigation will proceed normally, but `mail.mega.corp` won't be
    considered CORS-same-origin with the response.

  <h3 id="ip-address-space-heading">IP Address Space</h3>

  Every IP address belongs to an
  <dfn export local-lt="address space">IP address space</dfn>, which can be one
  of three different values:

  1.  <dfn for="IP address space" export>local</dfn>: contains the local
      host only. In other words, addresses whose target differs for every
      device.
  1.  <dfn for="IP address space" export>private</dfn>: contains
      addresses that have meaning only within the current network. In other
      words, addresses whose target differs based on network position.
  1.  <dfn for="IP address space" export>public</dfn>: contains all
      other addresses. In other words, addresses whose target is the same for
      all devices globally on the IP network.

  For convenience, we additionally define the following terms:

  1.  A <dfn>local address</dfn> is an IP address whose [=/IP address space=] is
      [=IP address space/local=].
  1.  A <dfn>private address</dfn> is an IP address whose [=/IP address space=]
      is [=IP address space/private=].
  1.  A <dfn>public address</dfn> is an IP address whose [=/IP address space=]
      is [=IP address space/public=].

  To determine the [=/IP address space=] of a given IP address (|address|),
  run the following steps:

  1.  If |address| belongs to the `::ffff:0:0/96` "IPv4-mapped Address"
      address block, then return the [=/IP address space=] of
      its embedded IPv4 address.
  1.  For each |row| in the
      <a href="#non-public-ip-address-blocks">Non-public IP address blocks"</a>
      table:
      1.   If |address| belongs to |row|'s address block, return |row|'s
           address space.
  1.  Return [=IP address space/public=].

  <table id="non-public-ip-address-blocks">

  </table>

  Note: Link-local IP addresses such as `169.254.0.0/16` are considered
  [=IP address space/private=], since such addresses can identify the same
  target for all devices on a network link. A previous version of this
  specification considered them to be [=IP address space/local=] instead.

  Note: The contents of each [=/IP address space=] were at one point determined
  in accordance with the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries
  ([[IPV4-REGISTRY]] and [[IPV6-REGISTRY]]) and the `Globally Reachable` bit
  defined therein. This turned out to be an inaccurate signal for our uses, as
  described in
  [spec issue #50](https://github.com/WICG/private-network-access/issues/50).

  ISSUE(36): Remove the special case for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses once access
  to these addresses is blocked entirely.

  <h3 id="private-network-request-heading">Private Network Request</h3>

  A [=request=] (|request|) is a <dfn export>private network request</dfn>
  if any of the following are true:

  1.  |request|'s [=request/current url=]'s {{URL/host}} maps to a
      [=private address=], and |request|'s [=request/client=]'s
      [=environment settings object/IP address space=] is
      [=IP address space/public=].
      
  1.  |request|'s [=request/current url=]'s {{URL/host}} maps to a
      [=local address=], and |request|'s [=request/client=]'s
      [=environment settings object/IP address space=] is either
      [=IP address space/public=] or [=IP address space/private=].

  <h3 id="headers">Additional CORS Headers</h3>

  The <dfn export http-header>`Access-Control-Request-Private-Network`</dfn>
  indicates that the <a>request</a> is a <a>private network request</a>.

  The <dfn export http-header>`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`</dfn>
  indicates that a resource can be safely shared with external networks.

  <h3 id="csp">The `treat-as-public-address` Content Security Policy Directive</h3>

  The <dfn>treat-as-public-address</dfn> directive instructs the user agent to
  treat a document as though it was served from a <a>public address</a>, even if
  it was actually served from a <a>private address</a>. That is, it is a
  mechanism by which private documents may drop the privilege to contact other
  private documents without a preflight.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "treat-as-public-address"
    directive-value = ""
  </pre>

  This directive has no reporting requirements; it will be ignored entirely when
  delivered in a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header, or within
  a <{meta}> element.

  This directive's [=initialization=] algorithm is as follows. Given an
  [=environment settings object=] (|context|), a `Response` (|response|), and
  a `policy` (|policy|):

  1.  Set |context|'s [=environment settings object/IP address space=] to
      [=IP address space/public=] if |policy|'s [=policy/disposition=] is
      "`enforce`".

  <h3 id="feature-detect">Feature Detection</h3>
  
  To determine the address space in which a context finds itself, a simple enum
  value is added to {{Document}} and {{WorkerGlobalScope}}:

  <pre class="idl">
    enum AddressSpace { "local", "private", "public" };

    partial interface Document {
      readonly attribute AddressSpace addressSpace;
    };

    partial interface WorkerGlobalScope {
      readonly attribute AddressSpace addressSpace;
    };
  </pre>

  Both attributes' getters return the value of the corresponding {{Document}}'s
  [=Document/IP address space=] or {{WorkerGlobalScope}}'s
  [=WorkerGlobalScope/IP address space=] property.

<!-- Big Text: Integrations -->
<section>
  <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This document proposes a number of modifications to other specifications in
  order to implement the mitigations sketched out in the examples above. These
  integrations are outlined here for clarity, but the external documents are the
  normative references.

  <h3 id="integration-fetch">Integration with Fetch</h3>

  This document proposes a few changes to Fetch, with the following
  implications:

  1.  [=Requests=] whose [=request/client=]'s
      [=environment settings object/IP address space=] is
      [=IP address space/local=] are unchanged from status quo. They may
      continue to make requests to IP addresses in any [=/IP address space=] as
      they do today.

      ISSUE(1): Chris Palmer suggests that we might want to change the proposal
      such that private services must always opt-in to being contacted by anyone
      other than themselves. That is, we'd force a preflight for all
      cross-origin requests to private servers, whether they come from public
      addresses, or private addresses.

  2.  [=Requests=] whose [=request/client=]'s [=/IP address space=] is
      [=IP address space/private=] are allowed to fetch resources from
      [=IP address space/private=] and [=IP address space/public=] addresses as
      they do today, but may only request [=IP address space/local=] resources
      if their [=request/client=] is a [=secure context=] **and** a
      [=CORS-preflight request=] to the target origin is successful.

  3.  [=Requests=] whose [=request/client=]'s
      [=environment settings object/IP address space=] is
      [=IP address space/public=] are allowed to fetch resources from
      [=IP address space/public=] addresses as they do today, but may only
      request [=IP address space/private=] and [=IP address space/local=]
      resources if their [=request/client=] is a [=secure context=] <em>and</em>
      a [=CORS-preflight request=] to the target origin is successful.

  Note: UAs must not allow <a lt="secure context">non-secure</a>
  [=IP address space/public=] contexts to request resources from
  [=private addresses=], even if the private server would opt-in to such a
  request via a preflight. Making requests to [=IP address space/private=]
  resources presents risks which are mitigated by ensuring the integrity of the
  [=request/client=] which initiates the request. In particular, network
  attackers should not be able to trivially exploit an endpoint's consent to a
  non-secure origin.

  To those ends:

  1.  [=Connection=] objects are given a new
      <dfn export for="connection">IP address space</dfn>, whose value is the
      [=/IP address space=] to which the connection's remote endpoint belongs.
      This applies to WebSocket connections too.

  1.  [=Response=] objects are given a new
      <dfn export for="response">IP address space</dfn> property, whose value is
      an [=/IP address space=], initially null.

  1.  The [$HTTP-network fetch$] algorithm is amended to add a new step in
      between steps 7.1 and 7.2, after successfully obtaining a connection:

      > 7.2. Set <var ignore>response</var>'s [=response/IP address space=] to
      >      <var ignore>connection</var>'s [=connection/IP address space=].

  1.  The <a>HTTP fetch</a> algorithm should be adjusted to ensure that a
      preflight is triggered for all <a>private network requests</a>. This might
      be as simple as changing the current "HTTP(S) scheme" block of the
      switch statement to the following:

      1.  If |request| is a <a>private network request</a>, return the result
          of performing an <a>HTTP fetch</a> using |request| with the
          |CORS-preflight flag| set.

          Otherwise, return the result of performing an <a>HTTP fetch</a> using
          |request| with the |CORS-preflight flag| unset.

      Note: We do not set the |CORS flag| in this case, as we're dealing with
      either a same-origin request that has been tainted by something like a
      [[#dns-rebinding]] attack, a navigation, or a `no-cors` request. The
      preflight alone should be enough to mitigate the risks of such requests.

      Note: This will require a preflight for <em>every</em> request initiated
      from a <a>public address</a> that targets a <a>private address</a>. This
      includes navigations.

  1.  The <a>CORS-preflight fetch</a> algorithm should be adjusted to append
      an <a http-header>`Access-Control-Request-Private-Network`</a> header for
      preflights triggered by <a>private network requests</a>. For instance, the
      following could be executed after the current step 5:

      6.  If |request| is a <a>private network request</a>:

          1.  If |request|'s <a for="request">client</a> is not a <a>secure
              context</a>, return a <a>network error</a>.

              Note: We don't need to touch the network to know that this request
              will be denied.

          2.  <a for="header list">Set</a>
              "<a http-header>`Access-Control-Request-Private-Network`</a>" to
              "`true`" in |preflight|'s <a for="request">header list</a>.

  1.  The <a>CORS-preflight fetch</a> algorithm should be further adjusted to
      ensure that consent is explicitly granted via an appropriate
      "<a http-header>`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`</a>" header in the
      response. For instance, the following could be executed before the current
      step 10:

      10. If |request| is a <a>private network request</a>:

          1.  Let |allow| be the result of <a>extracting header list values</a>
              given
              "<a http-header>`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`</a>" and
              |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

          2.  If |allow| is not "`true`", return a <a>network error</a>.

  1.  Finally, to mitigate the impact of DNS rebinding attacks (see
      [[#dns-rebinding]]), the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> should be adjusted to
      distinguish between request types. For example, we could:

      1.  Add "<dfn export for="cache">request network type</dfn>" to each cache
          entry, and change the <a>cache match</a> algorithm to take it into
          account.

      2.  Populate <a>request network type</a> according to the nature of
          |request| in steps 7.12 and 7.14 of the current <a>CORS-preflight
          fetch</a> algorithm.

      3.  Change the <a>cache match</a> algorithm to take

  ISSUE: [[FETCH]] does not yet integrate the details of DNS resolution into the
  Fetch algorithm, though it does define an <a>obtain a connection</a>
  algorithm which is a good start. We'll need to think about things like Happy
  Eyeballs [[RFC6555]] to make sure that we perform the right checks depending
  on the IP address we actually connect to. For the moment, this document
  assumes that connection information is available in the <a>HTTP fetch</a>
  algorithm. That might not be a reasonable assumption, in which case we'll
  need to revisit all of this.

  <h3 id="integration-websockets">Integration with WebSockets</h3>

  This document proposes a few changes to WebSockets, with similar implications
  to the above.

  1.  The <a>establish a WebSocket connection</a> algorithm should be adjusted
      to ensure that the endpoint is warned about <a>private network
      requests</a>. For instance, the following could be executed after the
      current step 7:

      8.  If |request| is a <a>private network request</a>, then
          <a for="header list">append</a>
          <a http-header>`Access-Control-Request-Private-Network`</a>/"`true`"
          to |request|'s <a for="request">header list</a>.

  2.  Further, the same algorithm should be adjusted to check the response for
      an opt-in. For instance, the following could be executed after the current
      step 12:

      13. If |request| is a <a>private network request</a>, then:

          1.  Let |allow| be the result of <a>extracting header list
              values</a> given
              "<a http-header>`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`</a>" and
              |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

          2.  If |allow| is not "`true`", return a <a>network error</a>.

  ISSUE: Look into this. Adding headers to the handshake seems reasonable, but we might need to go
  beyond that and require a preflight. Not sure what the capabilities of the GET are, and how much
  control the caller has.

  <h3 id="integration-html">Integration with HTML</h3>

  To support the checks in [[FETCH]], user agents must remember the source
  [=/IP address space=] of contexts in which network requests are made. To this
  effect, the [[HTML]] specification is patched as follows:

  1.  An [=/IP address space=] property is persisted on a number of objects:

      1.  {{Document}} objects are given an
          <dfn export for="Document">IP address space</dfn> property, whose
          value is an [=/IP address space=].

      1.  {{WorkerGlobalScope}} objects are given an
          <dfn export for="WorkerGlobalScope">IP address space</dfn> property,
          whose value is an [=/IP address space=].

      1.  [=Environment settings objects=] are given an
          <dfn export for="environment settings object">IP address space</dfn>
          accessor, which has the following implementations:

          1.  For {{Window}} objects: return the [=Document/IP address space=]
              of <var ignore>window</var>'s [=associated Document=].

          1.  For {{WorkerGlobalScope}} objects: return
              <var ignore>worker global scope</var>'s
              [=WorkerGlobalScope/IP address space=].

  1.  The [$create a new browsing context$] algorithm is amended with an extra
      step in between the existing steps 19 and 20. Thus the initial
      `about:blank` document inherits its creator's
      [=Document/IP address space=]:

      > 20.  If |creator| is non-null, then set <var ignore>document</var>'s
      >      [=Document/IP address space=] to to |creator|'s
      >      [=Document/IP address space=].

  1.  The [$initialize the Document object$] algorithm is amended with an extra
      step in between the existing steps 10 and 11, before the new
      {{Document}}'s [=Document/CSP list=] is initialized:

      > 12.  Set <var ignore>document</var>'s [=Document/IP address space=] to
      >      <var ignore>response</var>'s [=response/IP address space=].

  1.  The [$run a worker$] algorithm is amended with two extra steps in between
      the existing steps 14.4 and 14.5, after the new {{WorkerGlobalScope}}'s
      referrer policy is set:

      > 14.5. If |response|'s [=response/url=]'s [=url/scheme=] is a
      >       [=local scheme=], then set |worker global scope|'s
      >       [=WorkerGlobalScope/IP address space=] to
      >       <var ignore>owner</var>'s [=WorkerGlobalScope/IP address space=].
      > 14.5. Otherwise, set |worker global scope|'s
      >       [=WorkerGlobalScope/IP address space=] to |response|'s
      >       [=response/IP address space=].

  ISSUE(27): Find a place to insert address space inheritance from the
  navigation initiator for `data:` URLs.

  ISSUE(18): Capture the address space of the URL creator when
  `createObjectUrl()` is called on a blob, and inherit that when loading a
  document from the resulting URL.

  <div class="example">
    Assuming that `example.com` resolves to a [=public address=] (say,
    `123.123.123.123`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will have its
    [=Document/IP address space=] property set to [=IP address space/public=].

    If this {{Document}} then embeds an `about:srcdoc` iframe, then the child
    frame's {{Document}} will have its [=Document/IP address space=] property
    set to [=IP address space/public=].

    If, on the other hand, `example.com` resolved to a [=local address=]
    (say, `127.0.0.1`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will have its
    [=Document/IP address space=] property set to [=IP address space/local=].

  <h3 id="file-url">Where do `file` URLs fit?</h3>

  It isn't entirely clear how `file` URLs fit into the public/private scheme
  outlined above. It would be nice to prevent folks from harming themselves by
  opening a malicious HTML file locally, on the one hand, but on the other, code
  running locally is somewhat outside of any sane threat model.

  For the moment, let's err on the side of treating `file` URLs as
  [=IP address space/local=], as they seem to be just as much a part of the local
  system as anything else on a loopback address.

  ISSUE: Reevaluate this after implementation experience.

  <h2 id="security-and-privacy-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h3>

  The proposal in this document only ensures that the device consents to access
  from the public internet. Users agents SHOULD ensure that the <em>user</em>
  consents to such access as well, as it might be in their interests to deny
  such access, even though the device itself would allow it.

  This mediation could be done via an explicit permission grant, via some sort
  of pairing ceremony a la
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement">PAKE</a>,
  or any other clever interface which the user agent might devise.

  <h3 id="mixed-content">Mixed Content</h3>

  Note that the CORS restrictions added by the proposal in this document do not
  obviate mixed content checks [[!MIXED-CONTENT]]. Developers who wish to
  fetch [=IP address space/private=] resources from [=IP address space/public=]
  pages MUST ensure that the connection is secure. This might involve a solution
  along the lines of [[PLEX]], or we might end up inventing a new way of
  ensuring a secure connection to devices (perhaps the pairing ceremony hinted
  at above, or one of the ideas floated in [[SECURE-LOCAL-COMMUNICATION]]?). In
  either case, consenting to access by sending proper CORS is necessary, but not
  sufficient.

  Note: Doing something like the proposal here would make me more comfortable
  with relaxing the mixed content restrictions that prohibit unencrypted
  connections to loopback addresses. Right now, those aren't really subject to
  the kinds of concerns that drive most of [[MIXED-CONTENT]]'s decisions, but
  I'm reluctant to change Chrome's implementation without some protection for
  the local server and user.

  <h3 id="dns-rebinding">DNS Rebinding</h3>

  The mitigation described here operates upon the IP address which the user
  agent actually connects to when loading a particular resource. This check
  MUST be performed for each new connection made, as DNS rebinding attacks
  may otherwise trick the user agent into revealing information it shouldn't.

  The modifications to the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> are intended to mitigate
  this attack vector.

  <h3 id="scope-mitigation">Scope of Mitigation</h3>

  The proposal in this document merely mitigates attacks against private web
  services, it cannot fully solve them. For example, a router's
  web-based administration interface must be designed and implemented to defend
  against CSRF on its own, and should not rely on a UA that behaves as specified
  in this document. The mitigation this document specifies is necessary given
  the reality of private web service implementation quality today, but vendors
  should not consider themselves absolved of responsibility, even if all UAs
  implement this mitigation.
